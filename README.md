# AQI Prediction System -FIP240

## Project Title:
Source-Driven Air Pollution Analysis and Future Risk Mapping for Pune city

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) levels by analyzing and merging multiple real-world datasets including Weather Data, Traffic Data, and Pollution Data.
The objective is to identify key environmental and traffic factors affecting air pollution and build a regression-based prediction model.

## Problem Statement:
Air pollution is a growing concern in urban areas.
This project aims to analyze historical AQI data and predict air quality levels using machine learning techniques.

## Datasets Used:
- Pune AQI Dataset (2017–2024)
- India Daily Weather Dataset (2000–2024)
- Traffic Dataset

All datasets were cleaned, preprocessed, and merged for analysis.

## Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

 ##  Key Observations
- Weather conditions significantly impact AQI levels.
- Traffic density contributes to pollution variation.
- Data preprocessing improved model accuracy.
